QUESTION 1
=============================================================================
> Briefly explain the GIL assuming you were addressing a non-technical
>    audience. What are the potential cost implications of the GIL for
>    scaling a production application?

A Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism to ensure execute code
    one at a time. It was used by popular programming language reference
    implementation such as Ruby and Python.

It's works like drive in a single lane, all cars use the road exclusively
    at a given time. It's not a problem if for single lane road as of for
    single core CPU. However for multi-lane such as high way, the mechanism
    will restrict all traffic to single lane which is a great waist. As
    modern computer processor has multiple core which is like multi lane
    high way, software with GIL will not able take advantage of additional
    computing power to do the work in parallel in production.

To scale GIL application in production, team has to scale out horizontally
    or use system level process fork to get around the restriction, which
    add complexity and overhead to the solution.


QUESTION 2
=============================================================================
> Also for a non-technical audience, explain how a background job
>    queuing service could help when accessing external APIs.

Let's use local and online shopping as an example to explain the problem. There
    are lots of time consuming process in the whole shopping process:
          * get to the shop
          * find the right products with lucky
          * wait to pay
          * package and bring home

By local shopping, you have to physically do all those in sequence. By using
    online shopping, just a few click, you place the order and some time later,
    it will arrive to your door steps without much hassle.

External API is like expensive local shopping process, it could be slow and
    unreliable. A background job queue is like online shopping order, it will
    be looked after by the service provider and will get back to you when it
    complete successfully or failed.

A well designed queuing based service not only delivery superb user experience
    like local VS online shopping, but also bring new business opportunities
    to hide the complexity behind the scene and provide additional value added
    service along the pipeline.
